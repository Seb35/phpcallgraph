phpCallGraph
============

A tool to generate static call graphs for PHP source code. The graphs can be leveraged to gain a better understanding of large software systems or even to debunk design flaws in them.

Usage
-----

- Go to folder bin and run phpcallgraph.
- The generator requires at least PHP 5.2 (and tested also with PHP 7.0).
- In order to generate output formats other that 'txt' or 'cga' the Graphviz toolkit which can be downloaded at http://www.graphviz.org is required.
- For the 'umlgraph' output format you need pic2plot, which is part of the GNU plotutils package.

> bin/phpcallgraph [-f <string>] [-o <string>] [-r] [-d <string>] [-n] [-p] [-a <string>] [-v] [-g] [-h] [--] <string:sources> [<string:sources> ...]

> Options:
>     -f / --format           Set output format. Can be 'txt', 'array', 'umlgraph'
>                             'deadcode', 'cga' or one of the formats supported

>     -h / --help             Display help

Bugs and improvement
--------------------

This program has bugs, please open [issues](https://github/Seb35/phpcallgraph/issues) or, better, [pull requests](https://github.com/Seb35/pulls).

I plan to improve the quality of phpCallGraph:
* fixing major bugs: autoloading (e.g. Composer autoloader), missing indices in arrays
* in the longer term, improve the inner quality:
  * I was surprised because ezReflection does not add a lot of features compared to the standard (todayâ€™s) Reflection and it is responsible of quite a lot of warnings/fatal errors,
  * perhaps use some phpDocumentor Reflection packages ([Reflection](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/Reflection), [TypeResolver](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/TypeResolver)) if they prove to be good quality,
* in parallel, given the huge graphs it creates for huge packages like MediaWiki, I had the idea of creating a visualisation with [D3.js](https://d3js.org) to dive into the call graph with various zoom levels, perhaps linking the call graph of a plugin/extension to a high-level graph of the underlying software, displaying only relevant parts of it (exceptions, router, global functions, hooks); just an idea to be better defined and improved.

Miscellaneae
------------

### 3D Graph Exploration

You can use the CGA framework available at http://cgs.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/trac/cga/ to explore the graph with elaborate 3D visualization techniques.

In order to generate input file for CGA set the format option to `cga', e.g.

> phpcallgraph -f cga -o testfiles.str test/testfiles/

### Analysis of code in the global scope

Code in the global scope (outside any functions or methods) can be analyzed with the help of a little workaround: Such code can be manually wrapped in a dummy function called dummyFunctionForFile\_filename\_php() which will then be recognized by phpCallGraph. Of course this is not very elegant but currently the only feasible way due to some conceptual restrictions resulting from the utilization of the InstantSVC CodeAnalyzer.

### Dead Code Detection

You can get a list of methods and functions which are never called by using the output format 'deadcode', e.g.

> bin/phpcallgraph -r -f deadcode test/testfiles/

> bin/phpcallgraph -r -f array test/testfiles/ | php -r '$a = unserialize(file_get_contents("php://stdin")); var_export($a);'
> bin/phpcallgraph -r -f deadcode test/testfiles/
> bin/phpcallgraph -g -r -i "PHPCallGraph.php|lib/ezcomponents" -f png -o phpcallgraph-src1.png src/ lib/
